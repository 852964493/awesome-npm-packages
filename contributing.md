# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

**The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away because I'm so tired of nobody reading this document. Please carefully read everything in `Adding to this list`.**

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- If you just created something, wait at least a couple of weeks before submitting.
- You should of course have read or used the thing you're submitting.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not npmjs.com.
- Don't mention `Node.js` in the description as it's implied.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.
- Don't start the description with A or An.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your Pull Request

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
